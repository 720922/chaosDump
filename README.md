# chaosDump
A powerful and clean bash script to dump and extract information from Project Discovery's Chaos Project 

ChaosDump allows you to dump the complete data schema from https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io and allows you to dump actual datasets on the go. It is light weight and implemented in a very user friendly manner.
Created this as a learning to implement clean and crisp code. Tried my level best to not create any mess and kept the code very clean with a good architecture.
